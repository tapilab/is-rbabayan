Project Ideas:
1.Estimate the effects of genre of music interests on social behaviors and moods
I will design an algorithm to rate people’s social behavior based on the genre of music that they are interested
in. I will use Twitter REST API to collect tweets from users who either play a musical instrument or show
interests in one. Moreover, I will rate the tweets based on their sentiments and languages using cloud based text
analysis APIs (such as Google and IBM’s) to detect the mood of the user. The results can be evaluated by
comparing them with a control group. 


2.Determine the effects of user attributes on how much they love Star Wars!
I will design an algorithm that finds the relation between users’ attributes (such as gender, age) and their
interests in Star Wars the movie. I will use Twitter REST API to collect tweets from users who have tweets
related to Star Wars. I will then determine the users’ attributes and report their relation with their interests
in Star Wars movie. 


3.Estimate the effects of immigration on mental health 
I will design an algorithm to predict how immigration may impact one’s mental health and social behavior. I will
use Twitter REST API to collect tweets from those users who have immigrated from their home country. I will also
use cloud-based text analysis APIs to rate their tweets based on their sentiments and language to determine the
relation between their moods in tweets and the fact if they have immigrated or not. 
(I am personally interested in this topic but worried if it is going to be too difficult to find immigrant users
in Twitter.)

1. Enroll in CS 491, 591, or 597, as needed. (for 591, you'll need 5 credits, typically spread over two semesters).
2. Browse some of the papers from our lab: <http://tapilab.github.io/>
3. Bug Aron to create a github repo for you, which will look like this: <https://github.com/tapilab/ms-project-template>
4. Develop three project ideas and describe them briefly in the [Ideas.md](docs/Ideas.md) file in your repo.
5. The first week of the semester, we will meet to scope out a project, building on the ideas you listed above.
6. After we've defined the project, you should setup Milestones. See an example here: <https://github.com/tapilab/ms-project-template/milestones>
7. Create a set of Issues for each Milestone. We will use Issues to track progress. See examples here: <https://github.com/tapilab/ms-project-template/issues>
8. At the end of your project, you will submit a report (see example <https://github.com/tapilab/ms-project-template/tree/master/report>). 
9. You will also present your work at the end of the semester.
